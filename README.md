# Coflnet Mod

A frontend for sky.coflnet.com, inside minecraft.

## Usage

Download the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/coflbot/SkyblockMod/releases), or build it yourself.
Grab the .jar and place it without your `.minecraft/mods` folder, just like any other mod!

To use the mod, use /coflnet and change your settings. By default, it will use the free API, but you can upgrade to Premium on our [dashboard](https://sky.coflnet.com) to use the premium API for the best snipes.
